# Personal Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my personal Portfolio for browser based web applications. Inside you will find a fully functioning foundation that you need to begin to develop a set of board games. Everything is very modular and modifiable form so you can have creative independence in how you use the api & libraries. I chose to make my app using React; but any library or framework will pair easily. My portfolio is a summary of all the projects within. All are fully fuctional and can be used on [my personal website https://andrew-k.us](https://andrew-k.us) Thank you for coming by and enjoy.

## Language and Technologies

- Typescript
- Plain CSS
- Axios for all HTTP requests
- Vite for all testing
- Webpack for api bundler
- Vite for Apps and Libraries
- PostgreSQL for DB

## Structure of my portfolio

- It is broken into 2 parts with multiple sub-parts:

  
  - APPS
  - PACKAGES

  ### APPS

  My apps are divided into their languages:

  - Go
  - NodeJs
  - Python
  - React

  ### PACKAGES

  Packages handle the reusable and shared parts of all apps. Each can be built, deployed, and used independently. The sum are in Typescript since my other language apps contain all aspects of their code (at the momemt.)

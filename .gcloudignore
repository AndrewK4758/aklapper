# This file specifies files that are _not_ uploaded to Google Cloud

# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of

# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style

# file at that point).

#

# For more information, run:

# $ gcloud topic gcloudignore

#

.gcloudignore

# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files

# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line

# below:

export const promptBuilderHeaderText = `This is designed to help you structure & format your prompt to increase the probability of receiving your ideal response from your query. Using all of the available fields helps provide the best context to the LLM, but not all are required. Hover over the category label text for a more detailed explaination of what to add to the category. All uploaded files will be stored in a Google Cloud Storage Bucket upon upload, then added to your prompt query. The GCP storage buckets are persisted for the session only and all data will be deleted after a specific time. Each session has its own path in order to keep your data seperated.`;

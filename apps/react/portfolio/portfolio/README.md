# Portfolio

This is the root of my portfolio project. I try new tech from local to cloud deployment here.

## Use

- Defaults to dev mode

- Add '--configuration=production' to any command to run in production mode

  - ### Dev

    - Use command 'nx serve-server portfolio' to build the client & server then launch the dev server on port 4700

    - Runs in dev mode by default

  - ### Build

    - Use command 'nx build-both portfolio' to build the client & server
